git clone git@gitlab.com:devops-bootcamp3/git-project.git
cd git-project

# remove remote repo reference and create your own local repository
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

<summary>Exercise 2: .gitignore </summary>
<br />

You see that build folders and editor specific folders are in the repository and decide to ignore it as a best practice.

Ignore .idea folder, .DS_Store, out and build folders

Hint: remove from git cache first

**create .gitignore file with following entries**
```sh
.idea 
.DS_Store
out 
build
```

**remove cached commited files and commit .gitignore file**
```sh
git rm --cached .DS_Store

# -r for directories
git rm -r --cached .idea
git rm -r --cached out
git rm -r --cached build

# commit and push the changes
git add .
git commit -m "remove ignored files"
git push
```

<summary>Exercise 3: Feature branch </summary>
 <br />

Create a feature branch and change following:

- Upgrade the logstash-logback-encoder version to 6.6
- Add image to the index.html file (url: https://www.careeraddict.com/uploads/article/58721/illustration-group-people-team-meeting.jpg)

You are done with the changes. So:

- Check your changes using "git diff" and
- Commit them if everything is correct. Note: There is a standard in your team to name commits with descriptive text.
- Push your changes to your remote repository.

**steps**
```sh
# create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/exercise-3

# in build.gradle upgrade the version of the "logstash-logback-encoder" library from '5.2' to '6.6'
compile group: 'net.logstash.logback', name: 'logstash-logback-encoder', version: '6.6'

# in src/main/webapp/index.html add the following image tag:
<img src="https://www.careeraddict.com/uploads/article/58721/illustration-group-people-team-meeting.jpg" width="700" />

# check and commit changes
git diff
git add build.gradle
git commit -m "Upgrade logback library to version 6.6"
git add src/main/webapp/index.html
git commit -m "Add image"

# as this is a new feature branch there is no need to first pull remote changes

# push new feature branch to remote and track the remote branch
git push -u origin feature/exercise-3
```

<summary>Exercise 4: Bugfix branch </summary>
<br />

You find out there is a bug in your project, so you need to fix it using a new bugfix branch:
- Create a new bugfix branch
- Fix the spelling error in Application.java file

You are done with the changes. So:
- Check your changes using "git diff" and
- Commit them if everything is correct.
- Push your changes to your remote repository.

**steps**
```sh
# create bugfix branch
git checkout -b bugfix/exercise-4

# fix the spelling error in src/main/java/com/Application.java
log.info("Java app started");

# check and commit changes
git diff
git add .
git commit -m "Fix typo"

# as this is a new bugfix branch there is no need to first pull remote changes

# push new bugfix branch to remote and track the remote branch
git push -u origin bugfix/exercise-4
```

<summary>Exercise 5: Merge request </summary>
<br />

You are done with the feature, now it needs to be tested and deployed. So:
- Merge your feature branch into master (using a merge request)

**steps**
```sh
# merge feature branch into master. Alternatively do the merge from GitHub UI
git checkout main
git merge feature/exercise-3 

# push the merge to remote master
git push
```

<summary>Exercise 6: Fix Merge conflict </summary>
<br />

You are on the bugfix branch. You notice the logger library version is old, so:
- Update it to version 6.2 (Change the same location in bugfix branch)

Some time went by since you opened your bugfix branch, so you want the up-to-date master state to avoid major conflicts.
- Merge the master branch in your bugfix branch - fix the merge conflict!

**steps**
```sh
# switch to bugfix branch
git checkout bugfix/exercise-4

# in build.gradle upgrade the version of the "logstash-logback-encoder" library from '5.2' to '6.2'
compile group: 'net.logstash.logback', name: 'logstash-logback-encoder', version: '6.2'

# commit change locally
git add .
git commit -m "Upgrade logback library to version 6.2"

# bring bugfix branch uptodate with master branch. Alternatively do the merge from GitHub UI
git merge main

# you will get a merge conflict here for build.gradle file

# fix merge conflict (open build.gradle file and keep master branch version) and when done check the state
git add build.gradle
git merge --continue
git status

# if all fixed, you can commit and push the merge into your bugfix branch
git push

```

<summary>Exercise 7: Revert commit </summary>
<br />

Still on the bugfix branch. You also noticed a spelling mistake in the index.html file, so you want to fix that in the same branch.
- Fix the spelling mistake and commit the fix

You also want to update the image.
- So also change the image url (src) in a separate commit.

You are done with the changes:
- Push both commits to the remote repository. 


Your team members tell you the previous image was the correct one, so you want to undo it. But since you already pushed to remote, you must revert the change.
- Revert the last commit and push your changes to remote repository

**steps**
```sh
# on bugfix branch

# fix spelling error in src/main/webapp/index.html
<li>Sarah - Full stack devloper</li>

# commit change locally
git add .
git commit -m "Fix another typo"

# set image url in src/main/webapp/index.html to:
<img src="https://3kcz333h8wih3px3rh3vhfv3-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/effective-meetings.jpg" width="" />

# commit change locally
git add .
git commit -m "Adjust image url"

# push both commits to remote
git push

# revert last commit and push the revertion into remote repo
git revert HEAD
git push

```

<summary>Exercise 8: Reset commit </summary>
<br />

You found 1 last thing you think must be fixed. Bruno just moved to DevOps team, so Bruno's role must be fixed.
- Update the text accordingly
- Commit that fix locally (don't push to remote)

However after talking to a colleague, you find out it has already been fixed in another branch. So you want to undo your local commit.
- Since commit is only locally, you can reset the commit.

**steps**
```sh
# checkout bugfix branch

# make change in src/main/webapp/index.html
<li>Bruno - DevOps engineer</li>

# commit change locally
git add .
git commit -m "Adjust employee role description"

# reset the last local commit, meaning move to the previous commit
git reset --hard HEAD~
```

<summary>Exercise 9: Merge </summary>
<br />

This time you want to merge your branch directly into master without merge request. So:
- merge your bugfix branch into master using git CLI (Hint: master branch must be up-to-date before the merge)
- Being on the master branch now. Push your merge commit to remote repository

**steps**
```sh
# merge bugfix branch into master
git checkout master
git merge bugfix/changes

# push to remote
git push
```

<summary>Exercise 10: Delete Branches </summary>
<br />

Now that you are done, both feature and bugfix got deployed and you want to cleanup the old branches.
- Delete both branches both locally and remotely

**steps**
```sh
# delete branches remotely via GitHub UI

# delete branches locally with CLI
git branch -d feature/exercise-3
git branch -d bugfix/exercise-4

# if you didn't delete the branches remotely, delete them with CLI
git push -d origin feature/exercise-3
git push -d origin bugfix/exercise-4
```
